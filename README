# This is how you run terraform

1. Have a main.tf. Only one main.tf can exist.  for different environments, use different folders with one per

2. Run terraform with plan first.  the ./terraform here is the executable downloaded for the particular OS.

 ./terraform plan -var "server_port=8080"

If there are variables in the main.tf, then they can be called like this.

3. Finally "apply"

./terraform apply -var "server_port=8080"
